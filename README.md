# 🏏 Cricket Shot Classifier using Pose Estimation

This is a real-time AI project that classifies *cricket shots* using pose detection and machine learning.

## 🚀 Features
- Real-time webcam input
- Pose detection using MediaPipe
- Classification of cricket shots (e.g., Cover Drive, No Pose)
- Machine Learning model training and prediction
- Easy to extend with more shot types

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe
- scikit-learn
- Pandas
- joblib

## 📂 Project Structure
## 📦 Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repo or download ZIP
2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Run:
   - data_collection.py to collect pose data
   - train_model.py to train the classifier
   - real_time_prediction.py for real-time output
 ## 🧠 Future Improvements
- Add more cricket shots (pull, sweep, hook, etc.)
- Convert to a full web app using Flask or Streamlit
- Deploy the app on cloud (Render, Vercel, or Heroku)
- Add user-friendly UI for non-technical users
- Add accuracy metrics and charts for visual performance
